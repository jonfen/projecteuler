[Project Euler Problem #6](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6 "Project Euler Problem #6")

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2 +  2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural nubmers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 2025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 2025 - 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum fo the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
